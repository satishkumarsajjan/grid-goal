**GridGoal is a minimalist, distraction-free system that helps you achieve your long-term goals by visualizing your daily consistency.** It's built on a simple, powerful principle: you can't improve what you can't see.

Instead of tracking endless to-do lists, GridGoal helps you track your most valuable resource: focused time. Each session of deep work fills a square on your personal **Grid**, creating a living visualization of your dedication and building unstoppable momentum.
